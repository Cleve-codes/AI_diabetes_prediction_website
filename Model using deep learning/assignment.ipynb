    "## a. Algorithm Selection and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "For this classification task, I've chosen to implement a deep neural network using TensorFlow/Keras, alongside evaluating traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. This choice is justified by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity of the problem**: Diabetes prediction involves understanding complex non-linear relationships between various health parameters. Neural networks excel at learning these intricate patterns that might not be captured by simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature interactions**: Neural networks can automatically model feature interactions and hierarchical patterns at different levels of abstraction, which is crucial for medical diagnosis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance on medical data**: Recent literature shows deep learning models outperforming traditional approaches for diabetes prediction, especially when we have multiple correlated input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Probabilistic outputs**: Neural networks with sigmoid activation provide continuous probability estimates which are valuable in medical contexts where the confidence level of the prediction matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adaptability**: Deep learning models can be fine-tuned and improved as more data becomes available, making them suitable for medical applications that evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, I'll also implement and evaluate traditional algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines to provide a comprehensive analysis."
